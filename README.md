# scrap-mechanic-logic-converter
Converts blueprint logic blocks between Vanilla, [Vincling's Logic Blocks Mod](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2568516747), or the [Circuits Creator Mod.](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2289714402)

As of now, this only works on Windows.
Requires Python >=3.10.

## Notes
1. Make backups of your blueprints - This script could corrupt your blueprint or break it!
2. It is possible to convert very large blueprints, but I would suggest converting chunks of a blueprint at a time. Converting an entire blueprint may lead to unpredictable/undesirable results.
3. When converting blueprints to Vincling's mod, set the speed multiplier to x1 or single-step before spawning a blueprint. Circuits may cause the game to lag  if not properly optimized.
